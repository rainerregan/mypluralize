# Writing Hello World in console using node.js:
Write Hello World in node.js

in my code, i write console.log() method,

# Function of console.log() method.

console.log() method used for printing some text in the console.

example:

when i write code like this:

`console.log('Hello Sugar Labs team.....');`

-Save it somewhere with .js extension.
-Run CMD.
-And change the directory using "cd" command to your local project folder.
-And type command like `'node YOURFILENAME.js'`.
-Press enter.
-You will see `"Hello Sugar Labs team....."` in your console.

# Writing with string variable

You can change the words with string too.

ex:
```
var name = Rainer;

console.log('Hello ' + name);
```

and run cmd again,
you will see "Hello Rainer" in your console.

Thats's all for the `console.log()` method.

Thanks for reviewing.
